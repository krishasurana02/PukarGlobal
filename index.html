        <h2 class="mb-3 "><strong>OUR STORY</strong> </h2>

        <p>Established in 2019, a community service platform PUKAR Global based in Delhi NCR was set up. We wanted
            to
            make a difference, a day when no one sleeps empty stomach and possesses the right education to be
            independent. We analysed that we were doing no good to improve their situation and living standards of
            the
            underprivileged among our locality. It made us think a little deeper and we finally came to a
            conclusion.

            “We can't eradicate poverty by charity but by education. Unless they are taught to learn, to earn, to
            live,
            to pursue the talent they possess, we can't succeed in fulfilling their needs.”

            This “link” or enabling position has determined PUKAR Global’s strategic choices at every juncture –
            from
            the fundraising methods it employs, to the nature of its relationship with the people it partners with.
            We
            aim to spread blessings and fulfill wishes by linking beneficiaries with donors.

                                    But PUKAR Global is here to fulfil their dreams. Every winter, our organization
